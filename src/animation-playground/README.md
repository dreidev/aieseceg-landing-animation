# Animation Playgournd

This is meant as a space for developing animations that are later included in the project.

The do not change objects or tweens.js

You are expected to use objects and extend tweens with your own work

Then add your animation to the timeline as in liftBar.js

You are to create your own file for each animation demo.

It helps to have `sudo nom install -g browser-sync` and use it
also `sudo npm install -g jshint` in case you don't along with sublimeLinter and the SublimeLinter-jshint extenssion.

Useful tips
In addition to the timeline you can switch to select mode with `v`
use `n` to move up the tree to the elements parent group element
press `l` to log the current transformations on the element selected
In the `l` state you can click anywhere and you will get a log of the angle  relative to the element's center of rotation (not entierly accurate tho)
press `r` to enable rotation in case you want to try rotating elements on the fly relative to their center of rotation.
